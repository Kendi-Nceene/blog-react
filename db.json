      "description": "Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what developers need and providing them with a structure to build their code.\n\nOne of the key principles of Rails is \"convention over configuration,\" which means that it follows a set of conventions for how things should be done, rather than requiring developers to specify every single configuration option. This allows developers to get up and running with a new application quickly, and it helps to ensure that Rails applications follow a consistent structure.\n\nRails is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which separates an application into three main components: the model, which manages the data for the application; the view, which is responsible for rendering the user interface; and the controller, which handles incoming requests and communicates with the model and view.\n\nRails also includes a number of tools and features that make it easier to develop web applications, such as a built-in web server, a powerful routing system, and a robust set of libraries for common tasks.\n\nOverall, Ruby on Rails is a popular choice for web development due to its simplicity and ease of use, as well as its strong community of developers and its extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools.",
